### Installation
Bundled files are included in this repo so the kitten viewer works right out of the box.  
To get started working with the kitten viewer, run `npm install`

- the React version of the kitten viewer can be compiled by running `webpack`
  - If you don't already have webpack installed, make sure to also `npm install webpack -g`
- the Angular version relies on a CDN for easier hosting on Github Pages
- all versions are powered by flexbox, which may not be suitable for all browsers.
- this widget relies on a mouseover, so it is not mobile friendly
